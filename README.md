# admin-dashboard

Hey everyone! This is the last project that I will be doing for the Intermediate HTML and CSS course for the Odin Project! Today, I will be recreating an admin dashboard provided by the Odin Project using everything that I have learned up until now of HTML and CSS (forms, SVGs, selectors, positioning, maybe some CSS functions, and of course, CSS Grid!). With that being said, credits for all media that isn't mine will be linked below; make sure to go show all the creators of them some love. And once again, thank you for viewing this repo!
